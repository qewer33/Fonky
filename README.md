Fonky is a simple but powerful and intuitive Google Fonts frontend for KDE Plasma. It allows you to preview, install, remove, save, view metadata and developer information of the fonts in the Google Fonts database right from your desktop.

Built with Qt, Kirigami and Rust.

Currently in proof of concept and testing stage. Not sure how it will act on desktops other than KDE since it's not built with traditional C++ and KF. And needs more packaging options.
